# FactorioMegaResearch

![alt text](thumbnail.jpg "Mega Research")

Add technology research to help testing production and consumption of science packs when building a mega base of at least 1000 science per minute.

After the rocket launch, if you decide to build a mega base, this mod will provide the individual science pack research so you can test each science pack factory as you build, instead of waiting for all factories to be ready to use the infinity research.

No bonus or items are rewarded after each research, it only provides means to test production and consumption of science packs.
